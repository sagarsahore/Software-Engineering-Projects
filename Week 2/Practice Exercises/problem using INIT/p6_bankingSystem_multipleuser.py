""" 
Banking System with Multiple Users
Create a class called `Bank` that:

- Has a dictionary `users` where the key is the user ID and the value is an instance of a `BankAccount` class.
- The `BankAccount` class should have `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `display_balance()` methods (similar to Problem 2).
- The `Bank` class should have methods for adding a user, removing a user, and displaying all users.
